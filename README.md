# -Include-Custom-skin-support-Feature
This will fix the custom skin detection and give you a IsPlayerCustomUsingSkin function.
Why you should use this:
=======================
You can't keep using GetPlayerSkin alone and if you use a system that saves player skin and you give your players ability to choose custom skins if you use GetPlayerSkin alone it will return the base id and GetPlayerCustomSkin alone will return 0 if the player has no custom skin hence all players will have cj skin but with this it will check if the player is using a custom skin or not and set his skin based on that.
=====
Usage:
======
Simply download the include file in your script and it will all be fixed, you can also use IsPlayerUsingCustomSkin if you want.
